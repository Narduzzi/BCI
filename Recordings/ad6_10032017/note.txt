The subject was also trying to go through the centers in easy condition.

The signal quality was not good at all, but at least artifacts and alpha wave when closing eyes were apparent.
Iz and some other electrodes around occipital hardly contact the head well.

Fixed O2 right before 4th trajectory.
Fixed CP4 right before 15th trajectory.

Some electrodes seems noisy after experiments:
F3, F5, F7, FC5, FC3, C5, TP7, CP5, CP1, P1, P9, PO7, PO3, Oz, POz, FPz, AF4, F6, Cz, C6, P4, P6, PO8

Signal quality of EOG and EMG were also bad comapring to the subject in the same day due to unknown reasons. Unknown interference/noise was strong. However, patterns should be seen are still avaliable.
